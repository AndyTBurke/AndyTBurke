# Hi, I‚Äôm Andy Burke üëã
I'm mostly writing web apps with JavaScript and React, but sometimes I write programs with Python üêç.

### Projects
- **Turkey Cook Time**
  - Planning the Thanksgiving Day cooking schedule is very difficult, so this tool estimates the amount of time your turkey will take in the oven (or deep-fryer, air-fryer, smoker) to help you plan the day. There are a variety of options to adjust, depending on your cooking style and bird size. This was made with React for Thanksgiving 2022.
