# Hi, Iâ€™m Andy Burke ðŸ‘‹
I'm mostly doing web apps with JavaScript/React, sometimes Django or Flask or Node/Express. Sometimes I make stuff with Python, and [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/946326964/) is a guilty pleasure. I'd say I'm pretty good with SQL too.

### Projects
 - **Race Blueprint**
   -  Autogenerate and track 5K and Marathon training plans. Made with Django.
   -  [See it live](https://raceblueprint-6f3d1aad9898.herokuapp.com/)

- **Bulbs**
  - This web app encodes and decodes text messages into captivating binary patterns of bulbs, thereby facilitating an engaging, interactive experience to learn about binary code. Made with Flask.

- **Turkey Cook Time**
  - Planning the Thanksgiving Day cooking schedule is very difficult, so this tool estimates the amount of time your turkey will take in the oven (or deep-fryer, air-fryer, smoker) to help you plan the day. There are a variety of options to adjust, depending on your cooking style and bird size. This was made with React for Thanksgiving 2022.
